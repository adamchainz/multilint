5.0.1 (2020-07-22)
------------------

* Stop maintainence. I've moved my projects' linting to use
  `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/>`__.

5.0.0 (2020-07-04)
------------------

* Require ``isort`` 5.0.0+ and stop passing it the ``--recursive`` argument,
  which is now a default.

4.1.0 (2019-11-15)
------------------

* Support Python 3.8.
* Converted setuptools metadata to configuration file. This meant removing the
  ``__version__`` attribute from the package. If you want to inspect the
  installed version, use
  ``importlib.metadata.version("multilint")``
  (`docs <https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/importlib.metadata.html#distribution-versions>`__ /
  `backport <https://pypi.org/project/importlib-metadata/>`__).

4.0.0 (2019-08-11)
------------------

* Drop ``setup.py check`` support since ``twine check`` is the new, more
  complete, recommended way of checking distributable file correctness, as per
  the warning:

  .. code-block:: sh

      warning: Check: This command has been deprecated. Use `twine check`
      instead: https://packaging.python.org/guides/making-a-pypi-friendly-readme#validating-restructuredtext-markup


  ``multilint`` can't run ``twine check`` since it needs running on your
  ``dist`` files instead of the ``setup.py`` file.

  You can integrate it on a typical ``tox`` setup with an extra command
  ``tox dist/*``. For more information see the `twine check
  documentation <https://twine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#twine-check>`__ and
  the `packaging documentation
  <https://packaging.python.org/guides/making-a-pypi-friendly-readme#validating-restructuredtext-markup>`__.

3.0.0 (2019-05-13)
------------------

* Drop Python 2 and 3.4 support, only Python 3.5+ is supported now.
* Add support for running `Black <https://pypi.org/project/black/>`__, the
  Python code auto-formatter.
* Drop support for Flake8 < 3.0.0.

2.4.0 (2018-09-30)
------------------

* Support positional arguments for paths.

2.3.0 (2018-04-28)
------------------

* Fix for modernize 0.6.1+
* Run modernize on the multilint codebase itself, so it now requires six

2.2.1 (2018-03-08)
------------------

* Fix crash when setup.cfg doesn't exist.

2.2.0 (2017-09-19)
------------------

* Add ``--skip`` argument which can be used to skip particular linters even
  though they're installed.

2.1.0 (2017-06-02)
------------------

* Use ``entry_points`` in ``setup.py`` instead of ``scripts``
* Support ``python -m multilint``

2.0.2 (2016-12-06)
------------------

* Don't invoke ``python setup.py check`` if there is no ``setup.py``.

2.0.1 (2016-10-20)
------------------

* Remove default for `paths` in ``setup.cfg``.
* Check that paths exist before running the linters.

2.0.0 (2016-09-24)
------------------

* Use the config header ``tool:multilint`` in ``setup.cfg``, rather than
  ``multilint``, to avoid clashing with any potential ``setup.py`` commands.
  Your ``setup.cfg`` will need updating.

1.0.2 (2016-07-26)
------------------

* Work with ``flake8`` 3.0+ which changed the way its ``main`` function worked.

1.0.1 (2016-07-16)
------------------

* Fix modernize running on Python 2.
* Run ``isort`` in the same Python process rather than with ``subprocess``
* Properly gate ``flake8`` and ``isort`` so that they run only if they are
  installed.

1.0.0 (2016-06-19)
------------------

* First release on PyPI.
